# GPM
Quick CLI password manager I made for fun and personal use.

# Use
- Only requirement is pyinstaller. Install via `pip install pyinstaller`.
- Run the install script with admin `sudo python3 ./src/install_gpm.py` for Linux/OSX, `python3 ./src/install_gpm.py` with an administrator terminal for windows.

<h3> This password manager is WILDLY unsafe and only used for fun. Do not use this as a genuine password manager as it currently stores your passwords in plaintext. :) </h3>
